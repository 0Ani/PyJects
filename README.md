## Motivation

I have worked on various Python projects and hence decided to cluster them together into a repository for ease of access and to be able to track my progress. <br>
Each application has a specific functionality and a motivation behind why I made it. To read more about each of them, just open the folder and go through the **README.md** file

## Installation

Prerequisite : [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

For the latest collection of stable programs, head to [releases](https://github.com/SVijayB/PyJects/releases).

Download and extract the source code.

As an alternative, you could also clone the repository using,

<pre>
https://github.com/SVijayB/PyJects.git
</pre>

Some of these applications require you to download other modules or libraries. Make sure you read the usage section of the README.md file present in the folder of the application you are trying to use. 

Some applications use custom fonts. For complete user experience, it is suggested that you install them as well. <br>
Fonts are added to the application's assets folder.

## Usage

Once you have the source code downloaded and extracted. You can launch the applications by just double tapping on them, if you have the python launcher. Else, open up your terminal and cd to the `src` folder of the application you are trying to launch and type `python filename.py`, where filename is the name of the application.

Make sure you go through the `README.md` file present in the application's folder for complete understanding of the application's functionality and uses.
